##  Reflection

### Challenges with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Writing Terraform scripts from scratch was initially confusing, especially understanding dependencies and resource relationships.
- Learning how different providers work (e.g., AWS vs Azure) and authenticating properly took time.
- Managing state files and understanding `terraform apply` vs `terraform plan` was a bit tricky at first.

### Challenges with Manual Deployment
- Pushing images to the container registry required correct tagging and authentication steps (e.g., `docker login`, `docker tag`, `docker push`).
- Setting up the container service via the web console or CLI had a learning curveâ€”especially configuring environment variables and ports.
- Debugging deployment issues without logs (at first) made it challenging to know what was failing.

 I successfully deployed my containerized app to the cloud and provisioned the infrastructure with Terraform. It was a challenging but rewarding experience!
